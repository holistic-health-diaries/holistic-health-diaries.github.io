If sleep, diet, exercise, and psychological well-being are the key pillars of health, why doesn't your general practitioner move heaven and earth to support you in fixing them?

Itâ€™s complicated. 

Probably the most important reason is that medical doctors are still educated and paid (!) predominantly to treat acute problems. 
They often know comparatively little about preventive medicine and holistic health issues. 
Many of these subjects have also only emerged relatively recently, such as the supremely important role that the gut microbiome and systemic inflammation play in all kinds of health matters. 
Medical practitioners, who do not have much time to spend to keep up on the current medical research literature, simply have a hard time keeping up with all the new knowledge.

The result is the all-too-common scenario in which patients go to different doctors with different symptoms and are prescribed progressively escalating medications to address those symptoms, while at no point any attempt is made to ask: "Why are all of these symptoms occurring in the first place? 
What is the thing that is out of balance in this body, and what do we need to chance to address that?"

While one might wish that the medical system were more supportive about helping patients (and not-yet-patients!) get on a path to optimal health, there is also an important truth that sometimes gets forgotten in this age of modern medicine: 
**only *you* can change your health trajectory**. 
Your doctor can prescribe you some pills, but she cannot live a healthy life for you. 
*You* are the one responsible for keeping your body (and mind) healthy, not your doctor. 
If you want to live a healthy life, you have to work for it. 

With this responsibility also comes *empowerment*: 
you are not dependent on doctors for your health; you can take matters into your own hands! 
This means embarking on a journey to learn about your body, how it functions, and how you can best support it. 
As a result, you will, among other things, be able to talk to your doctors on much more equal terms, to tell them what you need from them and what you don't.  

Fortunately, it is nowadays easier than ever to access information about health issues, and there are many excellent, accessible, and often even entertaining books and podcasts on health topics available.
I will provide some pointers throughout the series, but with a bit of research you will also easily be able to find your own preferred sources. 

Finally, if all of this sounds... uhm... boring and *no fun*, remember this: 
*you do not know what you are missing out on!* 
I promise that if you improve upon your core habits in a meaningful way, you will simply feel so much better that you will never question whether this was "worth the effort" or not. 
Last but certainly not least: the process of learning about these things (and your body!), tweaking habits here and there and trying to figure out what works and what doesn't can also be a lot of fun in and of itself! :-)
