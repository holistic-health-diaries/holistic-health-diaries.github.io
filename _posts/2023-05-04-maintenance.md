[Miraculous as that thing is](2023-05-03-miracle.md), your body will keep running even if you treat it poorly. 
However, just like a bike or car that is not maintained properly, that will only work for so long. 
If you keep feeding it crap, couch potato-ing all day, and putting it into high-psychological stress mode all the time, it is only a matter of time until health issues *will* occur.

Maybe little surprisingly, essentially *any* study on factors that protect from diseases or health ailments (including basically any kind of hormone-related issues such as problems with fertility, depression, diabetes, cardiovascular disease, etc.) point, first and foremost, to "good maintenance practices":
- Sleeping well = giving your body a chance to perform some daily maintenance by itself
- Healthy diet = giving your body proper fuel to run on and maintain itself, and not actively poisoning it
- Exercising regularly = reminding your body every now and then that you really do need all those muscles, bones, and large lungs, and giving it a chance to test-run them
- Psychological well-being = not putting your body in a permanent state of stress

None of these will be particularly surprising to you, but they are mentioned so often for a reason: **these are really the core issues to address to solve almost any health issue, so much so that looking for "medical" solutions will almost never be long-term successful if these are not addressed first.** (There are exceptions, of course, such as some genetic diseases. Note, however, that for most diseases - even the ones which are often talked about as hereditary - genetics only play a relatively small role in disease development.) 

This is certainly not to say that medicine is useless, nor to "just go off your medicine and do things naturally". It does mean, however, that fixing deep-rooted health issues simply by taking some pill prescribed by your doctor will almost never work. [Medical doctors are neither educated nor paid to support you in fixing these core health areas; it is simply not their role.](/_posts/2023-05-29-trajectory.md) (Maybe it should be?) Modern medicine works wonders for saving acutely threatened lives, but is not doing great at preventing complex, long-term health issues.

Interestingly, the factors listed above - sleep, health exercise, psychological well-being - are all *intricately linked*. For instance, stress (can be due to anxiety, depression, high workload, family issues) leads to poor sleep, which leads to low energy levels and poor decision-making throughout the day, which can result in eating junk food and exercising less. All three will make you feel worse and rather dissatisfied (partly due to disrupted hormonal patterns), leading to psychological stress and poor sleep, thus creating a downward spiral. 

Fortunately, this also works in the opposite direction! Starting with addressing just one thing - say, improving sleep patterns or introducing one weekly exercise session - can initiate an upward spiral that touches upon all other aspects, as well.

While you probably already knew that these things were important, you're probably also finding them hard to implement in practice, just like essentially every other person on this planet. The whole purpose of the rest of this series is to arm you with the knowledge you need to actually get these things in order.

Returning to the bicycle analogy, it is easy to forget what a well-running bicycle *feels* like when youâ€™ve been using a poorly maintained one for a long time. Things slowly get worse over time, and you adjust to the new state, forgetting how easy it was to ride that bike a month ago. Healthy habits are similar: while in your daily trot, it is all too easy to lose sight of *how much better you could be feeling at this very moment.* You are not really aware of what you are missing out on! (Also recall again the downward spiral mentioned above and, in particular, the effect of poor health habits on poor mood.)
