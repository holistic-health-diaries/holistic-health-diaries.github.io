Hormones, and their rise and fall, affect everything about our daily experience.
Wikipedia [defines](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hormone) hormones as "a class of signaling molecules in multicellular organisms that are sent to distant organs by complex biological processes to regulate physiology and behavior."
The word stems from the Greek participle ὁρμῶν, "setting in motion".
In other words: hormones are the things that keep [all those incredibly complex and finely tuned processes throughout your body](https://holistic-health-diaries.github.io/2023/05/03/miracle.html) running.

Hormones and hormone cycles affect sleep, mood, fertility, food cravings, general energy levels, and much, much more.
Disbalances in hormone cycles are closely linked with many kinds of health issues.
Notable groups of hormones include:
- Sex hormones ("steroids") - mainly estrogen, progesterone, testosterone
- Wakefulness/sleep-related hormones - cortisol (the "stress hormone"), melatonin
- Metabolism-related hormones - e.g., insulin (most notorious for its role in diabetes)
- Growth hormones (GH)
- Thyroid hormones (T3 and T4)

Highly importantly, all of these hormones, and their respective daily rhythms, are highly interrelated and strongly affect each other.
Issues in one of them will often cause issues in another.
"Fixing hormone health" is fundamentally about bringing all of these different hormone cycles *in balance*.

Like most things in our body, hormone health is predominantly affected by what I call the "four key pillars of health":
- Sleep
- Diet
- Exercise
- Psychological well-being

As long as those key pillars are not in balance, "fixing" hormonal issues will be very hard.
The following parts of this mini-series will address how to work with those four pillars in order to improve hormone health.
